## Attributions

Thank you to the entire RosÃ© Pine community for spreading something beautiful
to so many different environments.

Thank you to the teams and individuals behind the tools we rely on:

- [Astro](https://astro.build) and the
  [astro-i18next](https://github.com/yassinedoghri/astro-i18next) plugin which
  implements [i18next](https://www.i18next.com). Internationalisation was a
  large factor when deciding which framework to use.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for a lovely developer experience.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for the majority of our frontend.
- [React](https://react.dev) and [cmdk](https://cmdk.paco.me) for our command
  menu.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for stress-free styling.
- [Tabler](https://tabler-icons.io) for our interface icons.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for hosting.
